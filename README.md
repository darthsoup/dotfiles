# darthsoup's dotfiles
These are the base dotfiles for my macOS environment. This config is running on macOS but it should work on Linux aswell.

## Installation

Checkout the repo somewhere in your `~/` Home Folder and call the very simple `sh install` script.


### git

dont forget to add your `.gitconfig.local` file

```ini
[user]
	name = 'Your Name'
	email = 'your@email.com'
```
